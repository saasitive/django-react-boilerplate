# DIY Django and React Boilerplate for SaaS

It is a do-it-yourself Django + React Boilerplate for starting your SaaS application. In existing boilerplates for Django+React (or just for Django), there are very often too many features provided (do you really need traffik for MVP?). So before starting, you need to remove a lot of functionality that you don't need or simply don't understand. 

I decided to create a simple Django+React boilerplate with step-by-step instructions on how to build it. During building, you can decide what you need or not. And for sure, you learn a lot about Django and React. I hope it will provide a good and quick starting point for creating SaaS applications. I want to create real SaaS applications based on this boilerplate with step-by-step tutorials on how they were created. They will be available on [SaaSitive](https://saasitive.com) website.

## Features (already implemented or planned)

- Backend with Django Rest Framework
- Frontend with React 
- Bootstrap for styling
- Deployment with docker-compose on a single VPS
- SSL certificate from Let's encrypt
- PostgreSQL database (not yet configured)
- Authentication with DRF `authtoken` and [Djoser](https://djoser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- AWS SES for Email sending (not yet implemented)
- python-decuple for secrets
- Payments with Stripe (not yet implemented)
- Step-by-step instructions on how to deploy and how to update the application
